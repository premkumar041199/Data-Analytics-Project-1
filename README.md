# Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

# Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from raw data loading to insights presentation.
The goal is to analyze the dataset, extract meaningful insights using Python and SQL, and present results through an interactive Power BI dashboard, a written report, and a presentation.

The project highlights skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, data visualization, and business-focused storytelling.

# Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas)
- MySQL (data storage and SQL queries)
- Power BI (interactive dashboard)
- Gamma (presentation creation)
- GitHub
